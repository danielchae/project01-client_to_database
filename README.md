## Project 1
### Submit data from client side to database

Learning how to take values defined by javascript (preferably jQuery) on the front end and upload those values to a database. Other than talking to the server, I’m curious about how data being sent to the server is structured. The only reference point I have for data structure is json and I’m still not even sure how json would fit into all this. I’ve only used static json strings so I understand it more as a syntax and not at all as a technology.

##### Objectives
* Values inputted by user (i.e. “favorite”) is stored in a database on submit.

* Values calculated dynamically by jQuery (i.e. timestamp of entries) is also stored in a database on submit.

* Explore different methods by which data can be structured.


##### Bonus Objectives
* I heard with purely PHP it requires a redirect to a separate PHP page that launches a specific script. I’d prefer a method that doesn’t require a page transition which I heard is doable through ajax?

* Display a prompt or run a function if an entry for that day already exists, with an option to cancel submit or override previous data.
